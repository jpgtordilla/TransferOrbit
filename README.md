Physics simulation of satellite orbits. Uses the Kepler general equation to compute trajectories. 

Interactive GUI with sliders to control the eccentricity of the orbit or the velocity of the satellite. 

Click the button to "transfer" to a different circular orbit (via a change in velocity). 

All graphics rendered are a result of calculating the angular velocity of the satellite and using these values to compute the radius of the orbit at different angles. 

The transfer orbit was computed by either raising or lowering the velocity of the satellite by a certain percentage, calculating the angular velocity, and updating the orbit. 

Object-oriented design principles and the pygame graphics library were used to create this application.
